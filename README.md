## How to use?

 You can switch the mode by clicking anywhere on the window.

 You can change the language by hovering over the gray bar at the top.

 You can go full screen by clicking on "OVKL ToolSys 2.0".

 Have fun! 😉

## How to install?

 You can now install an offline version of the clock via a PWA (Progressive Web App).

 In Chrome on PC, click on the top right of the URL bar on "Install Payday 2 Clock".

 In Chrome on Android, click on the three dots on the top right, then on "Add to Home Screen".

 For other browsers... It's up to you to find the option, I have no idea. 🤷‍♂️
